 * Operating Systems
 * Programming Assignment 3:
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Synchronize threads in accessing data
 * from a memory block using mutex and
 * counting semaphores. A seperate empty and full
 * counting semaphore is used to determine whether
 * a producer has space to write or a consumer
 * has data to read. The mutex implements mutual
 * exclusion among the shared memory block
 * so the producer and consumer can properly
 * synchronize their write and read
 * operations, respectively. Additionally,
 * a checksum is used on the last 2 bytes of
 * each 32 bytes block to validate the data.
 *
 * Compiling:
 * -----------------------------------------
 * gcc prodcon.c -o prodcon -lpthread -lm
 *
 *
 * Output with argument of <memsize>: 640, <ntimes>: 7.
